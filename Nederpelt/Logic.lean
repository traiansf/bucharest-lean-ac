  `intros` and `exact`

  Given an implication `p₁ → p₂` as a goal,
  the `intros` tactic will assume the premise of the implication
  as a local hypothesis, and ask you to prove its conclusion. 

  The `exact` tactic accepts a term,
  and closes the goal if the type of that term
  is the same as the goal.
-/
example : p → q → p := by 
  intros hp 
  intros hq 
  exact hp

/-
  You can `intros` several hypotheses at a time.
-/
example : p → q → p := by 
  intros hp hq 
  exact hp 

/-
  The `assumption` closes the goal if any of the local hypotheses match exactly the goal 
-/
example : p → q → p := by 
  intros hp hq 
  assumption

/-
  `exact` accepts any term, not just a local hypothesis.
-/
example : p → (p → q) → q := by 
  intros hp hpq 
  -- recall that an implication is just a function, 
  -- so we can apply `hpq` on `hp` to get something of type `q`.

You can use the `#print` command to see the definition of a constant.
As you see, `Not p` is defined as `p → False`.
The notation `¬p` can be used for it.

/-
  Beyond implication and negation, 
  the other propositional constructs, `False`, `And`, `Or` are defined inductively. 

  As such they have "introduction and elimination" principles which are analogous 
  to the natural deduction rules, and that simply follow from the type theory of Lean.
-/

/- You can use the `#check` command to see the type of a term -/
#check False.elim
example : False → q := by 
  intros h_false 
  exact (False.elim h_false)

/- The `apply` tactic lets you work on a goal backwards
   Given a goal of the form `p₂` and `h : p₁ → p₂`,
   `apply h` will transform the goal into `p₁`. 
-/
example : False → q := by 
  intros h_false 
  apply False.elim

example : p → ¬p → q := by
  intros Hp Hnp

/-
  `And` has two eliminators and an introduction principle.
-/
#check And.left
#check And.right
#check And.intro

example : p ∧ q → p := by
  intros hpq 
  exact (And.left hpq) -- `And.left hpq` can also be written as `hpq.left`

example : p → q → p ∧ q := by

/-
  The `rcases` tactic performs the deconstruction of a hypothesis of an induction type
  For example, it can be used to split a conjunction.
-/
example : p ∧ (q ∧ r) → r := by 
  intros h 
  rcases h with ⟨hp, hq, hr⟩

  `Or` is dual to `And`. It has two constructors and one eliminator.
-/
#check Or.inl 
#check Or.inr 
#check Or.elim

/- `rcases` works for `Or` too, but in this case, it will split the proof in two 
   and ask you to prove the goal under each of the assumptions.
-/
example : (p ∨ q) → (q ∨ p) := by 
  intros h 
  rcases h with hp | hq

  To prove an equivalence, you just need to prove both implications,
  as witnessed by `Iff.intro`
-/
example : (p → q → r) ↔ (p ∧ q → r) := by

/- Introducing a universal goal can be done again with `intros`, just like for implication. 
   After all, `→` is just a particular case of `∀`.

/- A `∀` is just a (dependent) function type, so a universal hypothesis 
  `h : ∀ x : α, p x` can simply be applied to an `a : α` to yield 
  `h a : p a`.

  A proof of `∃ x : α, p x` is (dependent) pair made 
  of a `w : α` (called the witness) and a proof that `w` satisfies `p w`.

/-
  Alternatively, the `use` tactic lets us give the witness
  and then instantiates the goal into proving that the chosen witness is indeed a witness.
